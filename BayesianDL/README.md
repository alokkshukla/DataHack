# A Gentle Introduction to Bayesian Deep Learning


This talk introduces the fundamental ideas behind the emergent field of Bayesian Deep Learning. 
Most of the material is borrowed from [NIPS Bayesian Deep Leraning Workshop](http://bayesiandeeplearning.org) proceedings. 
Many thanks to [Zoubin Ghahramani](http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/zoubin/) and [Yarin Gal](http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/yarin.gal/website/).

## Intended Audience

Someone with basic understanding fundamentals of Machine Learning and Neural Networks and The Bayes Rule.

## Outline

The talk is supposed to last about 45 minutes, with additional time for Q&A.

### Introduction

- Discussion about converging ideas
- How new and old amalgamate to bring something novel. 

### Bayes Rule and Bayesian Inference

- The famous Bayes Rule. 
- Discussion about priors, likelihood and posteriors. 
- The complete Bayesian Inference process. How posterior predictive models are used for estimation.  

### Neural Network - Revisited

- A simple neural network as function approximator. 
- Parameters and hyper-parameters of a Neural Network. 
- Discusion about point predictions and overfitting.

### Need of Bayesian Approach in Deep Learning

- How incorporating uncertainty is essential at times. 
- And what other benefits it might provide. 

### Bayesian Neural Network 

- Bringing priors to parameters in Neural Network. 
- Levels of unceratinty in a Neural Network.
- Implications. Discussion about how Dropout and Regularization can be expalined using Bayesain Reasoning.

### Bayesian Inference in Neural Networks

Discussion about various approches to posterior estimations - MCMC and Variation Inference.

### Bayesian Deep Learning in Practise

Introducing [Edward](https://edwardlib.org) - Tensors + Randomness

### Where are we?

Discussion about NIPS workshop. Leading researchers.
